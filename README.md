## Skills

- Languages: Python, SQL
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Flask
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- Concepts: Machine learning, statistics, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, model evaluation

## Projects

Here are some of the projects that I have worked on or contributed to:

- [ITSM Asset Misconfiguration Prediction](https://www.nobledesktop.com/learn/git/create-a-readme-file): A machine learning project that uses support vector machine to predict RFC and ITSM asset misconfigurations, using a similar dataset and problem statement as yours.
- [Improve ITSM Processes]: A repository that contains three notebooks that show how to improve ITSM processes, including predicting RFC and ITSM asset misconfigurations, using different models such as decision tree, random forest, and xgboost.
- [Data Analysis and Visualization]: A collection of notebooks that demonstrate various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python and its libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
